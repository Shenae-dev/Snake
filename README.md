# Snake

## The classic game

A course project.

>From Wikipedia:

>>Snake is a video game that came out in the late 1970s and has maintained popularity since then, becoming somewhat of a classic. The player controls a long, thin creature, >>resembling a snake, which roams around on a bordered plane, picking up food (or some other item), trying to avoid hitting its own tail or the "walls" that surround the playing >>area. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, its tail grows longer, making the game increasingly difficult. The user controls the direction of the snake's head (up, down, >>left, or right), and the snake's body follows. The player cannot stop the snake from moving while the game is in progress.

**Controls**: on a phone - swipe in the direction you desire to go.
          on a Mac/PC - hold down the left mouse button and swipe in the direction you want to go; release button.
